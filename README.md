# 👋 Hi, I'm Saad Jamshed  
### **Energy Scientist | Reactor Neutronics • CFD • Optimization | AI/ML-Assisted Energy Modeling**

I am an **Energy Scientist** transitioning from Physics → Thermal Energy Engineering → **computational modeling of advanced energy and nuclear systems**.  
My current focus is on **reactor neutronics simulations**, thermal-hydraulic modeling, and data-driven optimization for energy system analysis.

I combine **computational physics**, **reactor simulation**, and **AI/ML-assisted techniques** to enhance modeling accuracy, system performance, and design workflows.
